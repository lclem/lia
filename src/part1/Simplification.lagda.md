title: Simplification of formulas ðŸš§
---

In this chapter we study a procedure to simplify formulas of classical propositional logic.

```
{-# OPTIONS --allow-unsolved-metas  #-}
open import part0.Naturals using (â„•)

module part1.Simplification (nâ€² : â„•) where
open import part0.index
open import part1.Semantics nâ€²
```

# Formula size

When defining functions on formulas,
a straightforward structural induction often suffices.
<!-- as in `props` [above](#occurring-propositions) -->
However, this is not always the case, and for more complicated recursive definitions
we need to use other forms of recursion,
such as [well-founded recursion](../../part0/wf). TODO: FIX THIS LINK.
In such situations, it is useful to have a notion of *size* of a formula in order to show that the size decreases at each step.
The definition of formula size is given by structural induction on `Formula`:

```
size : Formula â†’ â„•
size âŠ¤ = 1
size âŠ¥ = 1
size (` _) = 1
size (Â¬ Ï†) = 1 + size Ï†
size (Ï† âˆ§ Ïˆ) = 1 + size Ï† + size Ïˆ
size (Ï† âˆ¨ Ïˆ) = 1 + size Ï† + size Ïˆ
size (Ï† â‡’ Ïˆ) = 1 + size Ï† + size Ïˆ
size (Ï† â‡” Ïˆ) = 1 + size Ï† + size Ïˆ
```

!example(#example:size)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the example formula `Ï†â‚€`, we have:

```
_ : size Ï†â‚€ â‰¡ 6
_ = refl
```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!exercise(#exercise:size-neg)(`size-Â¬`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prove that !ref(size) satisfies the following two inequalities:

```
size-Â¬ : âˆ€ Ï† â†’ size Ï† â‰¤ size (Â¬ Ï†)
size-Â¬Â¬ : âˆ€ Ï† â†’ size Ï† â‰¤ size (Â¬ Â¬ Ï†)
```

(This will be used in the chapter on [Normal Forms](../../part1/NormalForms).)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```
size-Â¬ _ = nâ‰¤sucn
size-Â¬Â¬ Ï† = trans-â‰¤ (size-Â¬ Ï†) (size-Â¬ (Â¬ Ï†)) 
```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


# Formula simplification


```
simplify : Formula â†’ Formula
simplify (âŠ¥ âˆ§ Ï†) = âŠ¥
simplify (Ï† âˆ§ âŠ¥) = âŠ¥
simplify (âŠ¤ âˆ§ Ï†) = simplify Ï†
simplify (Ï† âˆ§ âŠ¤) = simplify Ï†
simplify (âŠ¥ âˆ¨ Ï†) = simplify Ï†
simplify (Ï† âˆ¨ âŠ¥) = simplify Ï†
simplify (âŠ¤ âˆ¨ Ï†) = âŠ¤
simplify (Ï† âˆ¨ âŠ¤) = âŠ¤
simplify (Â¬ Ï†) = Â¬ simplify Ï†
simplify (Ï† âˆ§ Ïˆ) = simplify Ï† âˆ§ simplify Ïˆ
simplify (Ï† âˆ¨ Ïˆ) = simplify Ï† âˆ¨ simplify Ïˆ
simplify Ï† = Ï†
```
