This book is an introduction to propositional and first-order logic.
The material is developed using the proof assistant Agda.

Inspirations:

* [@plfa20.07] for showing that beautiful books can be written in Agda. A lot of the layout is inspired from [@plfa20.07].
* The [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) book (in [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/)).
* The [Xena project](https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/) lead by Kevin Buzzard on teaching undergrauate mathematics with the [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/) proof assistant.

A nice quote about the spirit of formalisation:
Simon (1956) wrote to Russell in late 1956 and described the work of the LT (Logic Theorist).
Russell (1956) replied, "I am delighted to know that Principia Mathematica can now be done by machinery. I wish Whitehead and I had known of this possibility before we wasted ten years doing it by hand. I am quite willing to believe that everything in deductive logic can be done by machinery."
